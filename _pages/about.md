Hello! I am Israt (pronounced iss-ruh-t). 
I am a Ph.D. candidate in the <a href="https://strassmannandquellerlab.wordpress.com/">Strassmann-Queller Group</a>. My Ph.D. at WashU is generously funded for 5 years by the <a href="https://global.wustl.edu/mcdonnell-academy/">McDonnell International Scholars Academy</a> where I am also the Bayer Sponsored Fellow. I am also part of the working group <a href="http://www.paradoxoftheorganism.com/speakers.html/">The Paradox of the Organism</a>. Check out my research page for current and past projects!

I received an M.Sc. at <a href="http://www.iitb.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay</a> in 2018. I did my dissertation in the <a href="http://www.bio.iitb.ac.in/~patankar/">Molecular Parasitology Lab</a> under the guidance of <a href="http://www.bio.iitb.ac.in/people/faculty/patankar-s">Professor Swati Patankar</a>. My undergraduate degree was B.Sc. Biochemistry with Honors from University of Delhi.


I am fluent in three languages - English, Hindi and Bengali. I have a working knowledge of Urdu (can understand and speak but not read and write). I primarily use R, Netlogo, and bash for programming.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
