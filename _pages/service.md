### Young Scientist Program

My longstanding interest in getting school children excited about scientific experiments led me to join the excellent [Young Scientist program](http://ysp.wustl.edu/index.php) at WashU. This team of graduate students from works together to bring sciences to the local schools and a lot of underprivileged students. I joined as a mentor to a high school student where I assisted the mentee through experiments and other school related things. We often interacted discussing about their aspirations and my life in science.

I soon took over as the Director of Finance in the program, thus moving from the bench to a more administrative role facilitating financial ease by smooth running of the existing system as well as looking for potential sponsors for future grants.

### Science for citizens

As a McDonnell Scholar, I had an opportunity to go to Washington DC and meet members of the Senate, chief reporters from New York Times, Fellows of Brookings Institution among many. We had great discussions about policy, health, climate change, science education and communication. We had a leadership seminar before this trip that prepared us for navigating difficult conversations learning from the experiences of leaders like [Barbara Schaal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_A._Schaal), [John McDonnell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McDonnell_(businessman)), [James Wertsch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Wertsch), Chancellor Emeritus [Mark Wrighton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_S._Wrighton), to name a few.  
These interactions have only strengthened my belief how important it is for scientists’ to be involved in policy and government. I hope to one day contribute towards bringing science from the labs to the public and their elected officials.
