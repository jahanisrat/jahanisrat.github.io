My research interests lie in the evolution of complex life via cooperation and conflict. Under this broad term, I am specifically focusing on development and maintenance of multicellularity for my Ph.D. thesis. For my experiments, I use the social amoeba *Dictyostelium discoidium*. In the long run, I want to study the implications of social interactions on the evolution of organismality and major transitions. I am also greatly intrigued by history and philosophy of science.

##### **Previous Projects**

During my first semester in Washington University, I worked with [Carlos Botero](https://biology.wustl.edu/people/carlos-botero) on experimental evolution in yeast. The project was a collaboration with [Justin Fay](http://www.sas.rochester.edu/bio/people/faculty/fay_justin/index.html) at University of Rochester and fellow graduate student Vince Fasanello, who I closely worked with. We performed phenotypic assays to study adaptation under fluctuating selection. We made 11 lines of yeast grow for 500 generations on three different conditions – high salt concentration, low salt concentration, and fluctuating salt concentration (alternating between high and low every 10 generations). The further research has headed over to the Fay lab where they are using high-throughput sequencing to identify the mutations involved in the adaptation.

Soon after my first semester, I worked on a short Biogeochemistry project with [Alex Bradley](https://eps.wustl.edu/people/alexander-s-bradley) at the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences. The broad goal for the project was to extract lipids and hydrocarbons from four carbonate samples from the Pescadero Basin hydrothermal system and then characterize the lipid structures by GC-MS. These can be interpreted to give some constraints on the carbon and energy flow through the microbial communities in these carbonates.

For my master's thesis, I worked on protein trafficking to the membranes of Apicoplast, a four membraned relict plastid in _Toxoplasma gondii_, an apicomplexan. _T. gondii_ is a parasite with cats as their final hosts, but can infect all nucleated cells. In humans, a _T. gondii_ infection (toxoplasmosis) is often asymptomatic except in cases of immune deficiency or pregnancy. Next time you pet your cat, think about what is making you love that little feline so much? Could it be _T. gondii_ ?
