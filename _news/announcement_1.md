I was invited to present my research on Multicellularity and Organismality!

The <a href="http://www.paradoxoftheorganism.com/speakers.html">Paradox of the organism</a> is a Templeton Grant funded working group organised by Arvid Agren and Manus Patten. The conference was held in Georgetown DC on November 8-9, 2022. It was a remarkable event where scientists presented their research on organismality in the face of conflict.
