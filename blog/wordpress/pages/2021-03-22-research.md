My research interests lie in the evolution of complex life. Under this broad term, I specifically focus on origins and development of multicellularity. I want to study how darwinian individuality evolves, and the interaction between such darwinian individuals at different hierarchical levels. These inquiries lead me to think about major transitions of evolution, emergence of complexity, bet-hedging, social evolution, cooperation and conflict. I am also greatly intrigued by history and philosophy of science.

I am fortunate to be able to pursue these questions under the guidance of my PhD advisors [Joan Strassmann](https://biology.wustl.edu/people/joan-strassmann) and [David Queller](https://biology.wustl.edu/people/david-queller). In the [Strassmann-Queller Lab](https://strassmannandquellerlab.wordpress.com/), I work with the social amoeba _Dictyostelium_ _discoidium_. This model organism is an excellent system to study group maintenance and cheating because of its chimeric nature in the wild. The lab also works on the relationship between _Dictyostelium discoidium_ and its symbiotic bacteria _Burkholderia._

##### Previous Projects

During my first semester in Washington University, I worked with [Carlos Botero](https://biology.wustl.edu/people/carlos-botero) on experimental evolution in yeast. The project was a collaboration with [Justin Fay](http://www.sas.rochester.edu/bio/people/faculty/fay_justin/index.html) at University of Rochester and fellow graduate student Vince Fasanello, who I closely worked with. We performed phenotypic assays to study adaptation under fluctuating selection. We made 11 lines of yeast grow for 500 generations on three different conditions - high salt concentration, low salt concentration, and fluctuating salt concentration (alternating between high and low every 10 generations). The further research has headed over to the Fay lab where they are using high-throughput sequencing to identify the mutations involved in the adaptation.

Soon after my first semester, I worked on a short Biogeochemistry project with [Alex Bradley](https://eps.wustl.edu/people/alexander-s-bradley) at the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences. The broad goal for the project was to extract lipids and hydrocarbons from four carbonate samples from the Pescadero Basin hydrothermal system and then characterize the lipid structures by GC-MS. These can be interpreted to give some constraints on the carbon and energy flow through the microbial communities in these carbonates.
