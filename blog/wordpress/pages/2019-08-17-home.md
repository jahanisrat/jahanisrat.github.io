Hello! I am Israt (pronounced iss-ruh-t). I am a graduate Student in the [Evolution, Ecology, and Population Biology](http://dbbs.wustl.edu/divprograms/eepb/Pages/default.aspx) (EEPB) Program (2018- ) at [Division of Biology and Biomedical Sciences (DBBS)](http://dbbs.wustl.edu/Pages/index.aspx). I am originally from India and I obtained an MSc in Biotechnology with my thesis under the guidance of [Swati Patankar](http://www.bio.iitb.ac.in/people/faculty/patankar-s) at the [Molecular Parasitology Lab](http://www.bio.iitb.ac.in/~patankar/) at [Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in/) (IITB). I received an undergraduate degree in BSc with hons. in Biochemistry from University of Delhi.

My PhD here at WashU is generously funded by the [McDonnell International Scholars Academy](https://global.wustl.edu/mcdonnell-academy/) where I am a resident scholar from the partner university IITB. I am studying the Evolution of Multicellularity at the [Strassmann-Queller Lab](https://strassmannandquellerlab.wordpress.com/).

_When I am not having fun with my social amoebae in the lab, I can be found reading fiction or listening to jazz. I love existential nihilism and Science memes, a lot_
