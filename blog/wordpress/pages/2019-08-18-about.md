Hello! I am Israt (pronounced iss-ruh-t). I am a graduate Student in the [Evolution, Ecology, and Population Biology](http://dbbs.wustl.edu/divprograms/eepb/Pages/default.aspx) (EEPB) Program at [Division of Biology and Biomedical Sciences (DBBS)](http://dbbs.wustl.edu/Pages/index.aspx). My PhD here at WashU is generously funded by the [McDonnell International Scholars Academy](https://global.wustl.edu/mcdonnell-academy/) where I am a resident scholar from the partner university IITB. I am studying the Evolution of Multicellularity at the [Strassmann-Queller Lab](https://strassmannandquellerlab.wordpress.com/).

I am originally from India and I obtained an M.Sc. in Biotechnology with my thesis under the guidance of [Swati Patankar](http://www.bio.iitb.ac.in/people/faculty/patankar-s) at the [Molecular Parasitology Lab](http://www.bio.iitb.ac.in/~patankar/) at [Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in/) (IITB) at Mumbai, a city by the Arabian Sea. I received an undergraduate degree in B.Sc. with honors in Biochemistry from University of Delhi. I pretty much lived in Delhi all my life - I grew up, went to school, finished college. All these years and a tiresome amount of international flights later, I landed in the USA. I am enjoying it and have found a home here, for now.

I am fluent in three languages - English, Hindi and Bengali. I have a working knowledge of Urdu. I think in some, and dream in all. I love listening to music, painting, singing, literature and basically all things artsy.
